    <h1 class="subTitle">The who</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Ferran, a 22 year old geology drop out, and this is my personal webpage, where I explain the why's and how's of my short fishing horror game created in 2025 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3072380/Undesired_Catch"> Undesired Catch</a>
    </p>

      That's me! In the Royal Tank Museum of Jordania
    </p>

    <h1 class="subTitle">The why
    </h1>
    <p>
      Undesired Catch started as a side project, its creation was intended to fund the main project of the moment,<a href="https://ferryferran.itch.io/the-highschool-experience-just-the-mapmost-of-it"> The High School Experience.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because, in order to publish a Steam page, valve asks for 100 US dollars to prevent page creation spamming, wich I didn't have at the time. 
      That was the case until my mother gave me a few bucks to prevent my wardrobe from starvation, you can guess where those bucks went.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was to spend a bit of money on the project, I decided to also spend a little bit more time on it than previously thought, and to take the opportunity to learn how a "real" game is made and published.
      The first step was to have an idea, what will the game be about? Will it be singleplayer? Will it be a first, third, fourth person game? I gave it a little thought and it seemed obvious that the game had to be a first person linear horror game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? because 1: Small indie horror games have a very healthy playerbase and content-creator echosystem 2: first person linear games are easier to do than third person or RTS style games (and make more sense given the "horror" decision).
    </p>
    <p>
      But what will the game be about? Horror games suffer from a variety of clich√©s, wich i'm not particularly fond of. Those being: Giant toy creature things that chase you around with a smile on their faces (poppy playtime, FNAF) Mascot horror in general (TGOBB)
      generic suburban house in the US haunted/stalked, you get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to be original, and after a bit of thought I came up with the idea of making a game about fishing crabs, and inside one of those cages, or "pots", there would be a monster, wich would kill you, eventually, I guessed.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subTitle">
      The how
    </h1>
    <p>
      With this, I got to work. I started by designing the fishing boat, wich the player would use to pick up the "pots" (that's how the cages where crabs are captured are called) and go around the map finding them.
      
      The ship needed to have all the elements necessary to fish crabs, those being: a crane to pick up cages, a bridge with the controls of the ship (steering, speeds...), living quarters for the crew (of one) and
      a hold to store all the catches.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had previous experience with 3d modelling thanks to some antique projects of mine, I had the ship ready in just a few hours.
