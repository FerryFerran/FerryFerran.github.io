    <p>
      The following is a detailed explanation on the inner workings of Undesired Catch, my short fishing horror game created in 2025, the Steam page being <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3072380/Undesired_Catch"> Here</a>
    </p>

    <p>
            Undesired Catch started as a side project, its creation was intended to fund the main project of the moment,<a href="https://ferryferran.itch.io/the-highschool-experience-just-the-mapmost-of-it"> The High School Experience.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
            This is because, in order to publish a Steam page, valve asks for 100 US dollars to prevent page creation spamming, wich I didn't have at the time. That was the case until my mother gave me a few bucks to prevent my dresser from starvation, you can guess where
            those bucks whent.
    </p>
    <p>As I was to spend a bit of money on the project, I decided to also spend a little bit more time on it than previously thought, and to take the opportunity to learn how a "real" game is made and published.
      The firs step was to have an idea, what will the game be about? Will it be singleplayer? Will it be a first, third, fourth person game? I gave it a little thought and it seemed obvious that the game had to be a first person linear horror game.
    </p>
    <p>Why? because 1: Small indie horror games have a very healthy playerbase and content-creator echosystem 2: first person linear games are easier to do than third person or RTS style games (and make more sense given the "horror" decision).
    </p>
    <p>
            But what will the game be about? Horror games suffer from a variety of clich√©s, wich i'm not particularly fond of. Those being: Giant toy creature things that chase you around with a smile on their faces (poppy playtime, FNAF) Mascot horror in general (TGOBB)
            generic suburban house in the US haunted/stalked, you get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
            I wanted to be original, and after a bit of thought I came up with the idea of making a game about fishing crabs, and inside one of those cages, or "pots", there would be a monster, wich would kill you, eventually, I guessed.
